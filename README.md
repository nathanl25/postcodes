# Project: Postcode Api

## Demo & Snippets

---

## Requirements / Purpose

- The Postcode API is an API written in Java that allows users to retrieve information of a postcode, such as the postcode, and the associated suburbs either by searching by postcode itself, or by suburb name. In addition a secure route also exists for creating new postcodes.

## Build Steps

## Design Goals / Approach

## Features

## Known issues

## Future Goals

- Implement front-end to showcase functionality of API
- Use of session based authorization via JWT

## Edge Cases

- Postcodes will have multiple suburbs, but at the same time some suburbs will belong to multiple postcodes. Logic will be implemented to handle this in the future.
